Built using React.js

User Story 1: I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.

User Story 2: I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.

User Story 3: I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
